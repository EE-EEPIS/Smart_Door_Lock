# EEPIS Smart Door Lock with Image Processing and Multiple Authentication Methods

This project implements a smart door lock system with multiple authentication methods, including pattern and pin code on an LCD touchscreen, fingerprint scanning, and RFID/NFC card detection. The system is designed to provide secure and convenient access control to a room or building.

## Features

- Image processing for facial recognition to grant access
- LCD touchscreen for entering pattern and pin code
- Fingerprint scanning for authentication
- RFID/NFC card detection for quick access
- Real-time monitoring of access logs

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4
- Pi Camera
- LCD Touchscreen
- Fingerprint Sensor
- RFID/NFC Reader

## Software Requirements

- Raspbian OS
- OpenCV for image processing
- Adafruit Library for LCD Touchscreen
- PyFingerprint Library for Fingerprint Sensor
- MFRC522 Library for RFID/NFC Reader

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi
2. Install the required libraries and dependencies
3. Connect the hardware components to the Raspberry Pi
4. Run the main.py file to start the program

## Usage

1. Power on the Raspberry Pi
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate using one of the available methods
3. Upon successful authentication, the door will be unlocked and a notification will be sent to the user's phone
4. Access logs can be viewed in real-time using the web-based monitoring dashboard
